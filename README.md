# CarDealerAPI
This API was for experimental purposes so its design is not as good and clean as the RestaurantTracker API. In it, you can perform CRUD operations using Dapper or Entity Framework. 
I also used Json Web Token based authentication and I followed the Layered Architectural pattern. 
After working with Microservices for a while this architectural pattern does not really impress me as much as it did the first time I learned about it.
