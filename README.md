# CarDealerAPI
This is an API in which you can perform CRUD operations using Dapper or Entity Framework. 
I also used Json Web Token based authentication here and I followed the Layered Architectural pattern. 
After working with Microservices for a while this architectural pattern does not really impress me as much as it did the first time I learned about it.
